        "Feature A lets you request products from abroad and a verified traveler "
        "brings them back with escrow protection. Feature B is an OLX-style "
        "marketplace where you can buy/sell locally with bargaining."
    ),
    "what is escrow": (
        "Escrow holds the buyer's funds securely until both pickup and delivery "
        "OTPs are verified. Once delivery is confirmed, funds are released to "
        "the traveler. If something goes wrong, an admin can refund."
    ),
    "how does pickup work": (
        "When a traveler picks up the item abroad, both parties verify a pickup "
        "OTP. The traveler also provides GPS location and a photo as proof. "
        "Status moves from ACCEPTED to PICKUP_OK."
    ),
    "how does delivery work": (
        "The traveler meets the buyer in Pakistan and both verify a delivery OTP. "
        "GPS and photo proof are captured. Status moves from PICKUP_OK to "
        "DELIVERY_OK, and escrow funds are released."
    ),
    "booking statuses": (
        "Booking statuses flow: REQUESTED -> HOLD_PLACED -> ACCEPTED -> "
        "PICKUP_OK -> DELIVERY_OK -> RELEASED. A booking can also be "
        "CANCELLED or EXPIRED at various stages."
    ),
    "what is kyc": (
        "KYC (Know Your Customer) verification requires uploading a CNIC or "
        "passport photo plus a selfie. An admin reviews and approves or "
        "rejects your documents. Verified travelers get higher trust."
    ),
    "marketplace rules": (
        "Feature B marketplace is peer-to-peer. ShareGo does NOT handle "
        "delivery or payment for marketplace transactions. Buyers and sellers "
        "arrange meetups and exchange items directly. You can send offers, "
        "counter-offer, and schedule meetups through the app."
    ),
    "how to send offer": (
        "On a marketplace listing, tap 'Send Offer' and enter your proposed "
        "price. The seller can accept, decline, or counter your offer. "
        "Once accepted, schedule a meetup to exchange the item."
    ),
    "what are policy flags": (
        "Certain products have special shipping policies. For example, "
        "lithium batteries are high-risk and may require special handling. "
        "Electronics and perfumes may have customs duty considerations. "
        "Always declare items truthfully."

    "how to create trip": (
        "Go to the Trips tab, fill in your origin airport, destination, "
        "travel date, available capacity in kg, and your fee per kg. "
        "Buyers can then browse and book your trip."

    "how to create request": (
        "Go to the Booking flow, enter the product name, specifications, "

    "is my data safe": (
        "ShareGo uses JWT authentication, bcrypt-hashed OTPs, and role-based "
        "access controls. Your personal data is never shared with other users. "
        "The AI assistant can only read your own data."
    ),
    "how ratings work": (
        "After a booking is completed (RELEASED) or a marketplace item is sold, "
        "both parties can leave a 1-5 star review. Your average rating is "
        "displayed on your profile."

# ── Gemini LLM integration ──────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are the ShareGo AI assistant. ShareGo is a peer-to-peer platform in Pakistan with two main features:

**Feature A (Cross-Border Delivery):**
- Users post "requests" for products from abroad (electronics, medicine, etc.)
- Verified travelers post their upcoming flights with available luggage capacity
- A booking matches a request with a trip. Escrow holds buyer funds until delivery is confirmed.
- Booking statuses: REQUESTED → HOLD_PLACED → ACCEPTED → PICKUP_OK → DELIVERY_OK → RELEASED
- Pickup and delivery are verified via OTP codes, GPS, and photos.

**Feature B (Local Marketplace):**
- OLX-style buy/sell marketplace for local transactions
- Users create listings, send offers, counter-offer, and schedule meetups
- ShareGo does NOT handle delivery or payment for marketplace transactions

**Other features:**
- KYC verification (CNIC/passport + selfie) is required for travelers
- Reviews and ratings after completed transactions
- Admin panel for dispute resolution and escrow management
- Shipping policy flags for restricted/high-risk items

You can also help:
- Travelers: Suggest places to explore in destination cities, local tips, food recommendations, cultural insights, and safety advice
- Buyers: Check if items are legal to ship between specific countries, customs requirements, documentation needed, and risk levels

Rules for your responses:
- Be helpful, concise, and accurate about ShareGo features
- Do not provide legal advice or facilitate illegal activities
- Do not make up features that don't exist
- If you don't know something specific about the user's account, suggest they check the relevant screen in the app
- Keep responses under 200 words
