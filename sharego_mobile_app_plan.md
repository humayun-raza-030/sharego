## C) Global Mobile Architecture & Behaviour

### State management

- Riverpod (recommended) or BLoC per module; feature folders: auth, profile, kyc, trips, requests, booking, handover, marketplace, offers, meetups, reviews, chat, ai, app(shell).
- Each feature: Repository (Dio), Notifier/Controller (state sealed classes: idle/loading/success/error/offline/pendingSync).
- Offline queue service for non-idempotent actions (offers, messages, booking create drafts, KYC submit optional).

### Networking (Dio)

- Base URL from `.env`; interceptors: auth (Bearer), refresh/reauth (if refresh token; else redirect to login on 401), retry with exponential backoff for network errors (respect offline detection), logging (redact PII).
- Timeouts: connect/read 15s; upload 30s.
- JSON serialization; handle date as ISO-8601 UTC.
- Media upload: multipart; compress images to 1600px; enforce 10MB; return relative path.

### Navigation

- Root: Splash/auth gate -> Home.
- Tabs or drawer? Use bottom nav with Home, Marketplace, Trips/Bookings, Chat, Profile.
- Nested flows: Auth stack; Feature A booking wizard; Trip creation wizard; Offer thread; AI chat modal route.
- Deep links: OTP screen from booking detail; chat from booking/listing detail.

### Design tokens

- Colors: Keep prototype feel; primary (teal/green similar to prototype accent), secondary warm yellow/orange; background light neutral; error red; success green. Ensure AA contrast.
- Typography: Prefer modern sans supporting Urdu (e.g., Poppins + Noto Nastaliq Urdu); defined sizes for H1/H2, body, caption; consistent button text.
- Components: Elevated buttons with rounded corners per prototype; cards with subtle shadow; chips for filters.

### Localization

- English default. Use `intl`. Copy strings dual-language; date/time localized to Asia/Karachi; currency formatter PKR; distance km.

### Permissions handling

- Camera/gallery: `permission_handler`; explain and fall back to file picker.
- Location: request when needed; if denied, allow manual text and mark gps_unverified.
- QR Scanner: runtime camera permission; degrade to manual OTP entry.

### Offline behaviour

- Detect connectivity; show banner.
- Cache: lists/details in local storage; queued actions persisted (offers, chat, some forms).
- Non-idempotent actions require explicit user consent to queue.
- Conflict resolution: refresh after reconnect; reconcile server truth vs optimistic.

### Error handling

- Normalize errors: validation (show field messages), 400 illegal transition text, 401 reauth, 403 owner check message, 404 not found, 429 throttle.
- Toast/snackbar for transient; inline for forms.

## Flutter Prototype Implementation Plan (UI-only, mock data)

Goal: Build a fully interactive Flutter app prototype with all flows using go_router, local mock data/JSON, and the prototype PDF visuals. No backend calls.

### Architecture snapshot

- Routing: go_router shell with bottom nav (Home, Marketplace, Bookings/Trips, Chat, Profile).
- State: simple ChangeNotifier/Riverpod mocks per feature (auth_mock, trips_mock, bookings_mock, listings_mock, offers_mock, chat_mock, audit_mock, ai_mock, kyc_mock).
- Data: bundled JSON for trips/bookings/listings/offers/issues/chats; placeholder images.
- Theme: match prototype colors/typography; PKR formatter; bilingual labels where helpful.
- Components: CTA cards (home), calendar month view, status pills, timeline list, offer/chat bubbles, disclaimer banner, OTP pin, skeleton loaders.

### Screen coverage (all wired with mock navigation)

- Auth: login, signup, OTP, forgot password.
- Home: location + welcome + hero + CTA cards (Earn, Book Services, Travelling, Visit Marketplace).
- Feature A booking: date/calendar, traveler list/detail, enter details, review, booking success, booking timeline, pickup/delivery OTP, QR scan mock, photo capture mock, GPS mock.
- Feature A trip creation: date, flight info, capacity, pricing, traveler info, summary, posted success, trip detail/manage.
- Feature B marketplace: list, detail (safety + disclaimer), create listing (review + success), offer panel, offer thread, counter/accept/decline/withdraw, meetup create/OTP, mark sold.
- Chat: chat list, chat thread with mock send.
- Audit Center: tabs (Open/Pending/Resolved), issue detail (timeline/evidence), report issue, add evidence; entry points from booking/listing/offer/handover screens.
- Profile/Settings: profile overview, edit, KYC upload mock with status banners, settings, logout confirm.
- AI Chat: command chips + dummy responses.
- Admin (hidden): admin audit panel list/detail with mock actions.

### Mock behaviors

- OTP always accepts "123456"; simulate 800ms loading.
- Lists/details show skeletons before mock load.
- Success screens after submits with CTA to detail/home.
- Error simulation buttons to show banners and Report Issue prompts.

### TODO (execution checklist)

- [ ]  Set up Flutter project skeleton with go_router, base theme matching prototype.
- [ ]  Add mock data models and seed JSON for users, trips, bookings, listings, offers, chats, issues.
- [ ]  Implement shared components (CTA cards, calendar, pills, bubbles, disclaimer, OTP pin, skeletons).
- [ ]  Build auth screens and wire mock auth flow to home.
- [ ]  Build home dashboard per prototype and link CTAs to flows.
- [ ]  Implement Feature A booking flow screens and navigation (including success, timeline, OTP, scan/photo/GPS mocks, report issue entry).
- [ ]  Implement Feature A trip creation wizard and success/detail.
- [ ]  Implement Feature B marketplace list/detail/create/offer thread/meetup/mark sold with disclaimer visible.
- [ ]  Implement chat list/thread with mock send.
- [ ]  Implement Audit Center (tabs, detail, report, add evidence) and hook entry points.
- [ ]  Implement profile/edit/KYC/status and settings + logout confirm.
- [ ]  Implement AI chat mock screen with command chips.
- [ ]  Implement admin audit panel (hidden route).
- [ ]  Add error/success/offline mock states and "simulate error" buttons where relevant.
