# ShareGo — FYP Evaluation Cheatsheet

## 1. Project Overview (Elevator Pitch)

ShareGo is a **peer-to-peer mobile marketplace for Pakistan** with two core features:
- **Feature A (Cross-Border Delivery):** Buyers request products from abroad, verified travelers carry them using spare luggage capacity, and simulated escrow protects both parties with OTP-verified handover.
- **Feature B (Local Marketplace):** OLX-style buy/sell with offer bargaining and meetup scheduling — no courier or payment handling by ShareGo.

Built with **Flutter (Android) + FastAPI (Python) + SQLite**, with a multi-LLM AI assistant (Gemini, NVIDIA, OpenAI) and a full admin dashboard.

## 14. Common Evaluation Questions & Answers

### Q: What problem does ShareGo solve?
**A:** Pakistan lacks a peer-to-peer platform connecting international travelers with buyers who need products from abroad. ShareGo lets travelers earn money from their spare luggage capacity while buyers get products at lower prices than traditional import. The marketplace feature also enables local buy/sell with built-in bargaining.

### Q: Why not use an existing platform like Grabr or PiggyBee?
**A:** Existing platforms don't target Pakistan's market, don't support PKR, and lack features like KYC verification for Pakistani IDs (CNIC), local marketplace, and Urdu-compatible design. ShareGo is built specifically for the Pakistan context.

### Q: How do you handle trust between strangers?
**A:** Multiple layers:
1. KYC verification (CNIC/Passport + Selfie, admin-approved)
2. Escrow holds buyer's payment until delivery is confirmed
3. OTP-verified handover (pickup + delivery) with GPS logging and photos
4. Tamper-proof seal ID matching between pickup and delivery
5. Rating & review system after every transaction
6. Dispute system with evidence upload
7. Admin oversight for escrow release/refund

### Q: Is the escrow real money?
**A:** No — it's a simulated escrow for FYP purposes. The wallet uses virtual credits with a ledger system (WalletEntry table). In production, this would integrate with Stripe, JazzCash, or EasyPaisa.

### Q: How does the AI assistant work?
**A:** Multi-provider architecture with automatic fallback:
1. Primary: NVIDIA gpt-oss-120b (120B parameter reasoning model)
2. Fallback: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini
3. Fallback 2: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

It has a strict system prompt limiting it to ShareGo-related questions, travel safety, courier guidance, and item legality. It can read the database (bookings, trips, listings) but cannot write. Rate limited to 30 requests/hour.

### Q: Why SQLite instead of PostgreSQL?
**A:** For FYP scope, SQLite with WAL mode is sufficient — zero configuration, no separate server process, supports concurrent reads. Alembic migrations make it easy to switch to PostgreSQL for production.

### Q: How do you prevent illegal items from being shipped?
**A:** Policy flags system detects restricted items (drugs, weapons, live animals, hazardous materials) and warns users. The AI assistant provides customs guidance per country. Admin can review and flag suspicious listings. KYC verification ensures user identity. However, ShareGo is a platform — users are responsible for compliance with customs laws.

### Q: What's your testing strategy?
**A:** Integration tests for critical paths:
- Auth: OTP flow, JWT validation, user creation
- Bookings: Full lifecycle (create → accept → pickup → delivery → release)
- Marketplace: Listing → offer → counter → accept → meetup → sold
- Ownership guards: 403 for unauthorized actions
- Rate limiting: 429 for exceeded limits

### Q: What would you do differently for production?
**A:**
- Real payment integration (Stripe/JazzCash)
- PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- WebSocket for real-time chat (replace polling)
- Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
- Automated KYC (OCR + face matching)
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- ML-based matching algorithm

### Q: How do you handle the admin panel?
**A:** Server-rendered Jinja2 HTML templates with cookie-based authentication. Separate from the REST API. Admin can: approve/reject KYC and trips, manage escrow (release/refund), moderate marketplace, manage users (make admin/delete), view audit logs filtered by admin/action/entity, and toggle feature flags.

### Q: What SDGs does this project align with?
**A:**
- **SDG 8 (Decent Work):** Creates income opportunities for travelers using spare luggage capacity
- **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption):** Enables sharing economy — optimizes existing travel capacity instead of dedicated shipping

### Q: How does the dark theme work?
**A:** Material Design 3 `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` with `Brightness.dark`. Theme mode is persisted in SharedPreferences. All screens use `Theme.of(context)` instead of hardcoded colors. Toggled in Settings via a `ThemeModeNotifier` (Riverpod).

### Q: How does the booking notification work?
**A:** When a traveler posts a status update (picked_up, at_airport, in_transit, arrived), the server automatically creates an in-app Message to the buyer with the update details. The buyer sees it in their Messages tab.
